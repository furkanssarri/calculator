# Calculator

## Description

This is a simple calculator application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides basic arithmetic operations, a clean user interface, and responsive design. This project was created as an exercise to learn and practice fundamental web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS styling.

## Live Demo

A [live demo](https://furkanssarri.github.io/calculator/) of the calculator can be found here.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Additional Functions**: Modulus and square root.
- **Clear and All Clear**: 'C' to clear the current entry and 'AC' to clear all.
- **Decimal Point**: Support for floating-point numbers.
- **Keyboard Support**: Use your keyboard to perform calculations.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS3**: A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
- **Sass**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
